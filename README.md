# TimeCapsule
TimeCapsule is a personal project created to save and archive interesting resources found on blogs, articles, and other web content.

The goal is to preserve this information before it potentially disappears, for future reference. This project is for personal use only and doesn't involve anyone else.

The aim is to build a library of web content, whether it's technical articles, analyses, thoughts, or tutorials, that I might want to revisit later.
